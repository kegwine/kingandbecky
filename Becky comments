7) Can we remove the "Purpose" tab??? I don't see a point to it - pretty obvious that the site's created for information and convenience

8) History - some comments as follows:

(i) 31122010 change to 31.12.10 
(ii) Number of gifts add in (as King would like to believe)"
(iii) Places travelled to - can remove? We never go thaaat many places lol i don't see a point also for this one.
(iv) Can we change the "History" to "Us"

9) Gallery section - add this line "Some photos of us taken by one of Becky's fondest friends and bridesmaid, the talented Ginny Pang @strangerhours" and maybe because it's a long text line, place the wording more towards the bottom?
